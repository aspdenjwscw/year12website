      <p class="homeinfobox"><br>

<strong>1. Use a Calendar or Planner</strong><br>
Write down all your assignments, tests, and important dates on a calendar.
That way you won’t forget anything and can see what’s coming up.<br><br>

<strong>2. Don't do everything at once.</strong><br>
If something feels huge, break it into smaller parts. Instead of 
"write essay" try "write intro", "research tasks about ... "<br><br>

<strong>3. Set a Routine</strong><br>
Having a regular schedule helps you know when to study and when to relax.
Try to study or do homework around the same time every day.
It helps build a habit and makes it easier to focus.<br><br>

<strong>4. Limit Distractions</strong><br>
Turn off your phone, close social media, and find a quiet place to work.
Distractions make it harder to get things done, you'll finish faster if you focus.<br><br>

<strong>5. Take Breaks</strong><br>
You can’t work all day without a break.
After 25–30 minutes of studying, take a 5-minute break to stretch or grab a snack.
This helps you stay calm, fresh and focused.<br><br>  

<strong>6. Start early</strong><br>
Don’t wait until the last minute to start your assignments.
Starting early gives you more time to think, research, and write.
It also helps you avoid the stress of rushing at the end.<br><br>

<strong>7. Ask for Help</strong><br>
If you’re stuck or confused, ask a teacher, friend, or family member for help. 
You're human and it's okay to need support. <br><br>

<strong>8. Stay Positive</strong><br>
Believe in yourself and your ability to complete the assignment. If you believe 
in yourself, you will be significantly more likely to complete the task at a faster rate, 
with a higher quality outcome. <br><br>

      <h3 class="homeinfoboxtitle">How to reduce stress</h3>
      <p class="homeinfobox">
<br>

<strong>1. Take deep breaths</strong><br>
If you feel stressed, take a moment to breathe deeply.
Inhale through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. 
This method helps calm your mind and body.<br><br>

<strong>2. Get fresh air</strong><br>
Go for a walk, sit outside, or just open a window. Fresh air and nature helps clear your mind.<br><br>

<strong>3. Talk to Someone</strong><br>
If you’re feeling overwhelmed, don’t keep it to yourself.
Talk to a friend, family member, or teacher. It really helps to share what’s on your mind.<br><br>

<strong>4. Get Enough Sleep</strong><br>
Your brain needs sleep to think clearly feel calm, and regenerate.
Try to get 8–10 hours if you can.<br><br>

<strong>5. Move Your Body</strong><br>
Exercise is a great way to reduce stress and feel better.
Even a little bit of exercise like dancing, stretching, or playing a sport
can boost your mood and reduce stress.<br><br>

<strong>6. Focus on one thing at a time</strong><br>
When you have a lot to do, it can be stressful.<br>
Don’t try to do everything at once, focus on one thing at a time.<br><br> 

<strong>7. Take Breaks</strong><br>
If you’re studying or working, take small breaks to rest your brain.
It helps you focus better afterward.<br><br>

<strong>8. Be nice to yourself</strong><br>
It’s okay to not be perfect, no one is. Just remind yourself you're doing your best, and that's what matters most.<br>
