      <h3 class="homeinfoboxtitle">Our purpose</h3>
      <p class="homeinfobox">This website was designed for WSC high-school students, giving them a free tool to manage, track and view all their assignments easily. 
        The google classroom you use everyday is good, but not sufficient. It does not provide enough necessary tools for students to easily know what exactly they have to 
        and when. <html lang="en">

      <h3 class="homeinfoboxtitle">The tools</h3>
      <p class="homeinfobox">This website provides students with two primary tools, a to-do list / task tracking tool, and a calender. The to-do list is more detailed 
        than the average to-do list. It has been designed for students that have assessments, so it will allow you to set a final due date, sub-dates for check-in points
        and details for each little part of your assessment. The calender is simple, but provides an overview of your assignments final due dates. There is in-depth customization.
