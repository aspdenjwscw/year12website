      <p class="homeinfobox">How to Manage Your Time (Especially for School Stuff)<br><br>

Time can get away from you fast, especially when school gets busy.<br>
Here are some simple ways to stay on top of everything without stressing too much:<br><br>

1. Use a Calendar or Planner<br>
Write down when things are due — tests, assignments, projects — all of it.<br>
That way you won’t forget anything and can see what’s coming up.<br><br>

2. Don’t Do Everything at Once<br>
If something feels huge, break it into smaller steps.<br>
Do a bit each day instead of cramming it all the night before.<br><br>

3. Make a Routine<br>
Try to study or do homework around the same time every day.<br>
It helps build a habit and makes it easier to focus.<br><br>

4. Put Distractions Away<br>
Phones, notifications, TikTok — they can wait.<br>
Find a quiet spot and knock your work out quicker.<br><br>

5. Take Breaks<br>
You’re not a machine. Work for 25–30 minutes, then chill for 5.<br>
Short breaks keep your brain from burning out.<br><br>

6. Start Sooner, Not Later<br>
Even just starting a task makes it feel less scary.<br>
The earlier you begin, the more time you have to fix things or ask for help.<br>

How to reduce stress?<br><br>

Feeling stressed is normal, especially with school and life stuff happening all at once.<br>
But there are easy ways to calm down and feel more in control:<br><br>

1. Take Deep Breaths<br>
Slow, deep breaths help your body relax.<br>
Try breathing in for 4 seconds, holding for 4, and breathing out for 4.<br><br>

2. Get Some Fresh Air<br>
Go for a walk, sit outside, or just open a window.<br>
Nature helps clear your mind.<br><br>

3. Talk to Someone<br>
Don’t keep it all in your head.<br>
Talk to a friend, family member, or teacher. It really helps.<br><br>

4. Get Enough Sleep<br>
Your brain needs sleep to think clearly and feel calm.<br>
Try to get 8–10 hours if you can.<br><br>

5. Move Your Body<br>
Even a little bit of exercise like dancing, stretching, or playing a sport<br>
can boost your mood and reduce stress.<br><br>

6. Do One Thing at a Time<br>
Don’t try to do everything at once.<br>
Focus on one task, finish it, then move on.<br>
It feels way less stressful.<br><br>

7. Take Short Breaks<br>
If you’re studying or working, take small breaks to rest your brain.<br>
It helps you focus better afterward.<br><br>

8. Be Kind to Yourself<br>
It’s okay to not be perfect.<br>
Remind yourself that you're doing your best — and that’s enough.<br>
